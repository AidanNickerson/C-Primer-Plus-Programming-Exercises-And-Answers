/* Programming Exercise 6-16 */

// Daphne invests $100 at 10% simple interest. (That is, every year, the investment earns
// an interest equal to 10% of the original investment.) Deridre invests $100 at 5% interest
// compounded annually. (That is, interest is 5% of the current balance, including previous
// addition of interest.) Write a program that finds how many years it takes for the value
// of Deirdre's investment to exceed the value of Daphne's investment. Also show the two
// values at that time.
