/* Programming Exercise 7-3 */

// Write a program that reads integers until 0 is entered. After input terminates, the
// program should report the total number of even integers (excluding the 0) entered, the
// average value of the even integers, the total number of odd integers entered, and the
// average value of the odd integers.

	float sum_even = 0, sum_odd = 0;      // the total number of two respectively
	int count_even = 0, count_odd = 0;  // the number of two respectively
	float average_even, average_odd; // the average value of two respectively
	
	printf("Please enter your numbers:\n");
	scanf("%d", &i);
